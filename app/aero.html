          SCL GLOBAL Concept is proud to introduce its largest-scale styling kit for the Lamborghini Urus so far. The
          extensive aerodynamic package incorporates 42 parts. <br>
          <br>
          The main and most technically challenging parts include the hood, the rear apron and diffuser, the front
          bumper, and the fender extensions (front fenders replaced completely). <br>
          <br>
          The aerodynamic kit comes in two forms to choose from: ultra-high-temperature Fiberglas (glass fiber
          reinforced plastic, GFRP) and Carbon (exclusive edition, complete with a unique pattern). <br>
          <br>
          All parts made from ultra-high-temperature Fiberglas (GFRP) weigh the same as the OEM parts, have standard
          thickness (2-3 mm), are extremely durable, and withstand temperatures up to +120째C (+248째F). <br>
          <br>
          The exclusive Carbon version of the kit takes advantage of manufacturing processes analogous to those found in
          the aeronautical industry and benefits from excellent durability, working temperatures exceeding +120째C
          (+248째F), and low weight (lighter than the OEM parts). <br>
          <br>
          Another advantage of carbon fiber comes in the form of its unique physical structure and visual aesthetics,
          which is particularly essential for luxury vehicle owners.
